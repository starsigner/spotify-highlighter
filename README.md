# Spotify Highlighter


**Spotify Highlighter** is a **Chrome Extension** that allows users to add songs to their Spotify playlists by highlighting text on the web. The extension makes use of Spotify's Web API by searching the user's highlighted text in the search engine and automatically adding the top song result to the specified user playlist.

This is a useful tool when browsing music-related forums and websites. Instead of having to manually open up spotify and search/add a particular song (ie. particularly useful for 'listen to later' playlists), the user can just right-click their highlighted text and choose one of their playlists from the popup menu.
